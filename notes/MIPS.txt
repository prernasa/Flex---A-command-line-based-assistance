# MIPS-32 Abstract:
-> MIPS microarchitecture is divided into the PROCESSOR side and the EXT MEMORY side
- 'Datapath' and 'Controller' are the two main sections of the PROCESSOR side
- 'Data Memory' and 'Instruction Memory' are the two main sections of the EXT MEMORY side
- Reading is asynchronous i.e. as soon as the Address is provided, the instruction or the data is given out
- Writing is Synchronous i.e. it occurs only when the WE/Write Enable bit is turned on

* Datapath:
	- It consists of the actually calculating machinery like MUX, ALU, etc.

* Controller:
	- It decodes the instruction fed into Datapath
	- It tells the Datapath how to execute a particular instruction/ calculation

* Instruction Memory:
	- It holds the 32-bit instructions, the CPU is supposed to execute
	- The PC/Program Counter is a register which keeps a track of the current instruction being executed by the CPU, hence it points to the Instructions Memory from the Datapath
	- Istructions can only be read. There is no WD/Write port in the Instruction memory

* Data Memory:
	- It holds the address of the data. It allows both reading and writing data
